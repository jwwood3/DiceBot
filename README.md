# DiceBot
DnD discord bot for dice rolls

Bot rolls dice allowing for:
Any number of any type of die (all dice must be of the same type for one command)
"best of" commands obtaining the best few results
Added modifiers
Adds up the sum of the results and modifiers

Alternate random distributions:
true - pseudorandom results, all with equal weight
fun - Chooses two players, one gets higher odds for a max roll and the other gets higher odds for a minimum roll.
	- These odds are set up by giving the weighted outcome a weight of 1.2 rather than 1.
