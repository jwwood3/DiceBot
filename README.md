# DiceBot
DnD discord bot for dice rolls

Bot rolls dice allowing for:
Any number of any type of die (all dice must be of the same type for one command)
"best of" commands obtaining the best few results
Added modifiers
Adds up the sum of the results and modifiers

Alternate random distributions:
true - pseudorandom results, all with equal weight
fun - Chooses two players, one gets 1/5 + 4/5N chance for a max roll (N = die size), the other gets the same chance for rolling a 1
